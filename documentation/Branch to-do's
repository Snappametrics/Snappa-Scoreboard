To-do's

From the issues page of our github here: https://github.com/mdewey131/Snappa-Scoreboard/issues/31

FIXED 1. Update number of shots in player_stats every round
FIXED  1a. This issue is almost completely fixed, but I need to make one more correction: When players use the 
        next round button to end the game, the round number should increment back one so that players don't
        have more recorded shots than is true. 
        
2. Add a description of the last game when asking players if they would like to restart
3. Change how the app decides to ask for a game restart
4. Update the logic from "throw some dice" so that
  players don't accidentally start the old game anyway
5. Restyle modal UI for restarting the game
