# Snappa-Scoreboard

## The Aspiration

This is the github home for an RStudio/SQL/probably Python soon project meant to allow some degenerates to quantify their debauchery, statistically.

What that means is that we wanted to 1) track the score in one of favourite games, 2) record player performance in each game, and 3) combine the hobbies of statistics and Snappa ([See wiki](https://github.com/mdewey131/Snappa-Scoreboard/wiki/An-Overview-of-SnappaMetrics)).

## What you'll find here:

- A Scoreboard in the form of an RShiny App which records game-level, player-level, and score-level information
- A PostgreSQL database used to store the data recorded in the Shiny app (or rather the code used to build it!)
- Analysis of our data using RMarkdown documents
