- Changed game_stats.points_per_round from real to double precision
- Added column game_stats.clink_points as integer
- Added game_id, score_id Primary Key constraint to scores table
- Added game_id, player_id Primary Key constraint to player_stats
- Removed Unique constraints from scores and game_stats because apparently a Primary Key constraint automatically does this?
