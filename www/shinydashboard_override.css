/* 
This CSS document creates overrides for some shinydashboard elements. The goal
here is to give us more control over the layout of html elements on each of 
our pages. In particular, the tabs (like Player Input, Scoreboard, etc) do not
Fit the entire width of the page, instead fitting only to the height of the 
content. Having more control over this would allow us to do things like pin the
start game button to a particular location
